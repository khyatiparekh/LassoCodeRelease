# Lasso regression

Lasso Regression is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization in order to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model it produces. Here, I have implemented lasso regression using coordinate descent algorithm. I have also included sample code that you can run on a simulated or a real world dataset. I have also written a library where you can compare the performance between sklearn and our implementation.

# DataSets
The hitters dataset that is used in the demo file can be found in the repository itself.
